                    <p>Since the outbreak of the pandemic (Jan 2020), China has primarily issued a <span class="tooltip">partial closure<span class="tooltiptext">A new policy which restricts access of specific groups of people, whether by certain nationalities, travel histories; those entering through a specified land, sea or air border; OR all land borders closed OR all air borders closed OR all sea borders closed (but not all three)</span></span> (1) on entry by foreign nationals, albeit a strict and comprehensive one. In early November 2020, China also implemented a series of country-specific <span class="tooltip">citizenship bans<span class="tooltiptext">A partial closure which bans foreign nationals from one country or group of countries, e.g. "entry to the country is denied to foreign nationals from Austria, Belgium, and France"</span></span> (11), with a <a href="http://www.fmcoprc.gov.hk/chn/wjbfyrbt/t1829637.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">press briefing</a> stating that Chinese embassies in the relevant countries would continue to announce these bans if necessary. </p>
                    <p>On 2-Feb, the Entry and Exit Administration of the People's Republic of China <a href="https://www.thestandnews.com/society/%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E5%85%A7%E5%9C%B0%E6%9A%AB%E5%81%9C%E5%AF%A9%E6%89%B9%E6%B8%AF%E6%BE%B3%E6%97%85%E9%81%8A%E7%B0%BD%E6%B3%A8-%E5%8C%85%E6%8B%AC%E8%87%AA%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%8C-%E4%B8%80%E5%91%A8%E4%B8%80%E8%A1%8C/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">halted processes</a> on all visas for entering Hong Kong and Macau. On Feb 17, the Shenzhen government <a href="https://www.thestandnews.com/china/%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E6%B7%B1%E5%9C%B3%E6%81%A2%E5%BE%A9%E9%83%A8%E5%88%86%E8%B5%B4%E6%B8%AF%E7%B0%BD%E6%B3%A8-%E5%8C%85%E6%8B%AC%E6%8E%A2%E8%A6%AA%E5%B0%B1%E6%A5%AD%E5%9F%B9%E8%A8%93%E7%AD%89/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relaxed</a> the restrictions to allow Shenzhen citizens to travel to Hong Kong.</p>
                    <p>Beginning on 28-Mar, China prohibited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200327173542/https:/www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/t1761867.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most foreigners</a> from entering the country by temporarily suspending entry of all foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits still valid to the time of the announcement on 26-Mar. Entry by foreign nationals with APEC Business Travel Cards were also suspended, as well as several temporary visa or visa-free travel policies, such as port visas, the 24/72/144-hour visa-free transit policy, the Hainan 30-day visa-free policy, a 15-day visa-free policy specified for foreign cruise-group tours, and several visa-free policies aimed at foreign tour groups from Hong Kong, Macau, and specific ASEAN countries. Foreign nationals with visas issued after the announcement on 26-Mar were unaffected by the suspension. This policy was not given a specific end date but was announced to be “a temporary measure” that “w[ould] be calibrated in light of the evolving situation and announced accordingly.”</p>
                    <p>On 28-Sept, China <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201001204634/https:/www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/t1817370.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slightly eased this restriction</a>, announcing that foreign nationals holding valid Chinese residence permits for “work, personal matters, and reunion” are allowed to enter China without needing to apply for new visas. However, all other measures in the 26-Mar remain in place.</p>
                    <p>On 4-Nov, the Chinese embassy in <a href="http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/chn/gdxw/t1829526.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the U.K.</a> announced a ban on all traveling into China from non-Chinese nationals within the U.K., regardless if individuals “[hold] currently valid Chinese visas and residence permits for work, private affairs, or groups”. This began a series of citizenship bans—shortly after on 5-Nov, Chinese embassies in <a href="http://be.chineseembassy.org/chn/lsfw/aqtx/t1829527.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belgium</a>, <a href="http://bd.chineseembassy.org/chn/lsyw/lstx/t1829556.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="http://ru.china-embassy.org/chn/fwzn/lsfws/zytz/t1829736.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia</a>, <a href="http://ph.chineseembassy.org/chn/sgdt/t1829558.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Philippines</a>, <a href="http://ua.china-embassy.org/chn/zgsg/t1829631.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukraine</a>, <a href="http://www.amb-chine.fr/chn/sgxw/t1829691.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">France</a>, <a href="http://it.china-embassy.org/chn/lstz/t1829700.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Italy</a>, <a href="http://ng.chineseembassy.org/chn/hzqzqw/t1829791.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nigeria</a>, <a href="http://et.china-embassy.org/chn/lsxx/t1829801.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethiopia</a>, and <a href="http://in.china-embassy.org/chn/sgxw/t1829641.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">India</a> made identical announcements. These measures were again announced to be temporary and to be modified by a separate policy at a later date. </p>
                    <p>China has, to date, not implemented any policies to fully close specific land, air, or sea borders<a href="#foot1">[1]</a>. However, China has maintained <a href="http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-04/09/c_78956.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very tight control</a> on many of its borders, with some borders, such as the border with Vietnam, decreasing from 20.79 million inbound and outbound travels in 2019 to <a href="http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-05/19/c_80298.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only 80 on average per day in May 2020</a>. International flights were also heavily restricted, with international airlines only allowed to maintain <a href="http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-03/27/c_78394.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one route into China</a> that sends one flight per week. It is also notable that soon after the outbreak of the pandemic (Jan 2020), <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/china-neighbors-close-borders-coronavirus-sars-1484978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly all of China’s neighbors</a> quickly closed their borders with China.</p>
                    <p>In order to alleviate the pandemic’s impact on the economy, Chinese officials are permitting essential business travel from <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2020/06/14/the-singapore-china-fast-lane-for-essential-travel-key-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singapore</a> and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/over-1000-business-travellers-have-benefitted-from-fast-track-entry-deal-between" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Korea</a> under fast-track arrangements. These measures exempt selected business personnel from strict quarantine measures so they can conduct business amid the pandemic.</p>
                    <p>
                        <h4 style="font-weight:bold;">Hong Kong:</h4>
                        Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has implemented implemented partial closures based on <span class="tooltip">travel history<span class="tooltiptext">A partial closure which bans travelers who, regardless of nationality, have recently travelled  through or from a specified country or group of countries, e.g. for "All travelers who have been to or travelled through China, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, and Japan are advised to not enter the country, and may be denied entry" </span></span> (2) and air travel by non-residents (1). Hong Kong has also implemented a variety of strict quarantine policies.
                    </p>
                    <p> On 20-Jan, the Food and Health Bureau announced that all passengers traveling by air from the city of Wuhan into Hong Kong were required to submit a “<a href="https://www.thestandnews.com/society/%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E6%98%8E%E8%B5%B7%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E6%8A%B5%E6%B8%AF%E8%88%AA%E7%8F%AD%E6%97%85%E5%AE%A2%E9%A0%88%E5%A1%AB%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E7%94%B3%E5%A0%B1-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8C%85%E6%8B%AC%E8%A5%BF%E4%B9%9D%E9%AB%98%E9%90%B5%E7%AB%99%E7%AD%89%E9%99%B8%E8%B7%AF%E5%8F%A3%E5%B2%B8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Health & Quarantine Information Declaration</a>.” This policy did not cover those from Wuhan entering Hong Kong via high-speed train.</p>
